{\an8}

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.250
Why does he keep following me?

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.005
Beats me.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.351
Hey, kid. Go away. Shoo.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.270
Come on. Really?

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.939
He's been tagging along
because he likes you,

00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:47.357
so be kind to him.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.109
Who is that kid anyway?

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:54.364
His name is Haetae, and while he may be
too young to realize yet,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:57.159
he has special powers
like the rest of you.

00:01:57.993 --> 00:01:58.994
Haetae?

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.662
What is he exactly?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.332
God created him

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:06.335
by giving him one trait
from each of you 12 angels.

00:02:08.295 --> 00:02:10.464
But among all the angels,

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.717
he was made to resemble you the most.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.801
Me?

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.222
We look nothing alike.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.226
Haetae will become

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.562
a guardian of the human world

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:30.484
alongside you and the other angels.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.864
We can manage just fine on our own.
He'll be a nuisance.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:39.743
- Play with him.
- No, go away. Shoo.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.453
Don't be like that.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.705
Come here. Go to him.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:50.879
Don't follow me.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.174
Go.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.638
Look at him go.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.601
Chief.

00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:51.148
We should move out.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.066
It seems to be done over there.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.873
We exist to protect humans.

00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.375
Don't forget that.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.046
Certainly. I will take it to heart.

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:31.122
TWELVE

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.964
Bangwool, can we please stop?

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:42.342
Never mind the risks. I'm starving now!

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:47.305
I'm going to eat them all.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.070
{\an8}ANGEL CAPITAL GROUP

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.950
That was one heck of a day.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.034
You did good today.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.372
Guys, where were you today?
The House of Angels?

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:13.999
Hey, Wonseung.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.002
Where were you,
and why weren't you picking up?

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.128
What?

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.964
Well, you see…

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:25.093
I was helping Marok with something.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.637
The drug bust you mentioned?

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.556
Yes, that drug bust I mentioned.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.766
I was out all day and am starving.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.602
{\an8}"60CHICKEN"

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.770
{\an8}- It's fried chicken! Nice.
Let's go.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.272
Let's go.

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:39.608
Inside we go.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.154
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.364
Mirr, try this.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.450
This isn't just crispy.
It's super crunchy.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.118
Is it that crunchy?

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.082
Dip it in the sauce. It's good.

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.380
Mmm… That's tasty.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:03.548
Right?

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:06.343
It's even good
with tteokbokki sauce.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.345
Try it. Go ahead.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.059
- It's good.
- Right?

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.272
- Have some.
- That looks good.

00:07:22.734 --> 00:07:24.694
- This is your bonus for the month.
- Hmm…

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.071
Can you pass this along?

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.531
- Here.
- Pass it along.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:30.116
Mirr too.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.368
Oh!

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:32.452
Bangwool.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.623
Each of you, give me one to donate.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.541
Here.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.086
Like Chief said, we need to be rich

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.712
because we'll be living forever.

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:46.633
So, Kangji, you can't take from us
and give what's ours to humans.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.926
Hey.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.553
Just hand it over, will you?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.681
You already have more
than you could ever spend.

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:53.848
She's right.

00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:57.560
I'm sick of counting all the zeroes
in my bank account.

00:07:57.644 --> 00:07:58.895
Hand it over already.

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.814
- Give it here.
- Hand it over.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.107
Thank you.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:05.318
By the way, it's been quiet.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.613
Were they simply evil spirits in hiding?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.240
That makes no sense.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.243
We'll soon have answers,
so don't worry so much.

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:15.328
What do you mean?

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.874
Ah… Mirr, you wouldn't know
because you were away for so long.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.335
But from now on,

00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:25.046
if you have any questions or need help,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.048
come to me first. Got it?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.509
Why would she when we have Chief?

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.638
Bangwool,
he's been acting strange since yesterday.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:36.057
Could an evil spirit have fried his brain?

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.184
What? As if.

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.855
Let her examine you.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.690
No, I'm fine. I'm all good.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:46.651
I said I was fine.

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.278
I'm fine.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.697
Fine. Do your thing.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.285
Why so serious?

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.704
She says you're too dumb.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.789
What? I'm too dumb?

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.166
You must be a pea brain.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.168
That hurts.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.211
Hey, you're here.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:07.005
Have some chicken. It's tasty.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.299
- This--
- I had beef for dinner.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.801
- Is Taesan inside?
- Yes.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:13.970
Eat up.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.735
Come on.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.156
As if hitting the bottle nonstop

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.159
will change anything.

00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:10.628
Samin, you…

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.381
Have you ever laughed before?

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:16.885
I guess you haven't.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.561
How about a laugh?

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.314
What are you playing at?

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.275
Smile a little.

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:35.403
Who knows?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.698
Maybe if you amuse me…

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.703
I might find
all of Haetae's soul stones for you.

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.245
No!

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:30.917
Unbelievable.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.255
Damn it.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:40.343
What is it?

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:43.513
Did you dream about the kids again?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.891
Are you okay?

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.019
Of course. I've gotten used to it.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.983
Anyway, you should ease up
on the drinking now.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.069
I barely had any.

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:02.907
You see…

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:12.417
Taesan.

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.044
I believe Ogwi…

00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:18.965
has been awakened again.

00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.650
NATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE
OF CULTURE

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:16.355
How did he escape?

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:18.691
It seems like Samin

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.027
awoke him.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.614
That's why

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.785
under no circumstances can Ogwi meet Mirr.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.288
Ever since the evil spirits reemerged,

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.957
I had Wonseung track Samin down.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.376
I told you to keep my kids out of this.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.338
Evil spirits could appear any time,
anywhere. We must be prepared.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:46.052
Okay, then.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.888
Tell them about Samin and Ogwi,

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:50.890
but only tell me
once you have their location.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:53.684
Sure.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:59.565
Anyway, why has Samin
remained in hiding all these years,

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.944
only to come back and unleash Ogwi?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.908
Now that Ogwi has awakened…

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.537
it will be a headache.

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.793
I should've killed him back then.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:15.266
P&J RECYCLING

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.585
What's this?

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.824
Unbelievable.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.202
Huh?

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.038
Wait, what's this?

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.166
{\an8}

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.297
Malsook, are you okay?

00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:16.178
You've still got it, Mirr.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.930
Look who's talking.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.225
Why do you still have your powers

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.185
when we've lost ours?

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.313
Is it because of the Dragon Soul?

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:26.731
I'm just as clueless.

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.483
I'm glad at least you have your powers.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:32.695
You'll train with me again
tomorrow, right?

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.280
Of course.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.115
You suddenly seem to be going all out.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.035
I should be of help to the family.

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.578
Let's go.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:43.456
We have to recover fast
if we want to train harder.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:44.582
Sure. Let's go.

00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.381
Why did you get us so much?

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.091
This place has great cakes.

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:56.344
We deserve this after all that training.

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.514
Here. This milk cream cake is to die for.

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.225
I'll eat it myself, so go ahead.

00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.686
I rarely offer to feed someone.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.147
So don't make me look like a fool

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.899
and just open your mouth.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.276
This is a reward for coming back to us.

00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:19.450
It's really good.

00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:21.494
We'll come here every day after training.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.079
The buns here are just as good.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:29.543
Why aren't you answering me?

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:32.880
I don't know if we can do that

00:19:34.382 --> 00:19:36.217
because of the evil spirits.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.804
Mirr, don't overthink it.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.764
This isn't our first rodeo,

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.183
and last time, it was the evil spirits
who ran off.

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:45.768
We'll do as we've been doing.

00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.437
After we catch them,

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.606
Marok will vanquish them
with a magic barrier.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.362
We don't know
where the evil spirits came from

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.698
or how many exist.

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:00.574
Besides,

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.619
Marok is a human at the end of the day.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.872
He hasn't explicitly mentioned it,

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:09.333
but he used more power
than he should've the other day.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:13.546
If the evil spirits come back
and attack before he's recovered,

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.800
his body won't be able to handle
the staff's power.

00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:26.809
Did you perhaps

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.437
have a vision?

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:34.483
It's about time you were honest about it.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.695
Wasn't it your visions

00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.115
that made you leave us before?

00:20:47.121 --> 00:20:48.122
I'm sorry.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.585
But I didn't have any visions.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.922
I only asked because I was frustrated.

00:20:57.006 --> 00:20:58.758
You don't need to apologize.

00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.050
Geez.

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.927
Now I feel guilty for bringing it up.

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:07.475
All right. Let's worry about this later
and dig in for now.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:18.360
Is this good for the body?

00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:21.739
What?

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.410
I should drink this
if evil spirits appear and I'm in danger?

00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.706
This will enhance my powers,
but when the effect wears off,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.625
I'll be in excruciating pain?

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:35.836
Bangwool, please.
I don't like being in pain.

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:40.257
So what if I'll quickly recover?
Did you give it to the others too?

00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.303
This is the last vial? How so?

00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:48.766
Because it was made with a medicinal herb
that disappeared 400 years ago?

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.935
Bangwool, you should've made more.

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.647
Marok, are you going somewhere?

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.399
Yes, to the police station.

00:21:57.483 --> 00:21:59.068
Are you quitting the force?

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.028
I have a feeling I'll be busy,

00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:04.824
and I don't want to be a nuisance
to my coworkers.

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.784
What do you mean, things will get busier?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.662
Well, we'll talk in the evening.

00:22:12.706 --> 00:22:14.124
Do I just drink this?

00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.003
It smells nice.

00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:21.298
TAESAN BUILDING

00:22:21.382 --> 00:22:23.008
Looking good.

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.558
Jwidol, Marok told everyone to gather.

00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:32.935
Just a second. I'm almost done.

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:34.603
What's this?

00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:36.897
Malsook put in a request.

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:40.901
This is one good-looking sword.
Where's ours?

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:42.862
Give it here.

00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:46.031
It took me forever to make this one.
Maybe, if I have time.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.785
Hey, that's mean.

00:22:49.869 --> 00:22:51.537
- Do you have a crush on Malsook?
- What?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.540
Of course not. Me?

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.041
That'd be insane. We're family.

00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:59.169
Exactly.
You don't do that with family. Let's go.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.130
Sure, let's go.

00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:10.097
- Delicious, right?
- Yeah, Bangwool should've come.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.641
- Mirr.
- Oh, yes?

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:18.981
We need to talk.

00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.317
Sure.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.501
Mirr, I have something to ask.

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:40.586
Sure.

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.213
Didn't someone come see you recently?

00:23:44.214 --> 00:23:45.215
Me?

00:23:46.216 --> 00:23:48.135
No, no one did.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.140
What's this about?

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:56.352
That day, it was you

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.646
the evil spirits were after.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:03.651
What? Ogwi's back?

00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:05.486
What are you saying?

00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:07.404
Marok, you sealed Ogwi yourself.

00:24:08.197 --> 00:24:10.240
It turns out Samin is still alive.

00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:13.744
It appears he awakened Ogwi.

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:15.746
Is that why evil spirits reemerged lately?

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.999
- That's right.
- Marok, I have to ask.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:22.711
Mirr is still clueless, right?

00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:30.094
Me?

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:32.054
What for?

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.847
That's what we're trying to figure out.

00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:36.225
We need to know what they're after.

00:25:01.792 --> 00:25:03.043
Mirr.

00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:04.962
- Mirr.
- Yes?

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.340
Marok and I will look into it,

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:10.718
so don't leave the house
for the time being.

00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:13.929
- Chief, let me help--
- No, do as I say.

00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:16.682
But Chief.

00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:36.994
Why are they suddenly gathering?

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.078
What's going on?

00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:35.696
- Please don't do this.
- Move.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:38.615
Chief, please. Don't do this.

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.994
We lost members of our family.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.454
Move.

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.124
Don't!

00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:04.850
You defied God

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.394
and brought ruin to the world.

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:11.106
You've already ruined my everything.

00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:13.984
Do as you wish.

00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:15.944
I will end you myself.

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:41.011
Chief, help us.

00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:42.763
We're still in pain.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:43.972
It hurts too much.

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:46.892
- Please.
- Mirr, Marok, even Geumsoon.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.352
They'll all die.

00:28:54.274 --> 00:28:56.360
Chief, we're here.

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:06.912
Taesan, Wonseung located Ogwi and Samin.

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.471
Is there just one left now?

00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:30.560
Yes.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.021
Locate the last soul stone,

00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:35.983
take the Dragon Soul from Mirr,

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.360
and merge them to give it life.

00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:42.656
Then, you'll possess
all of Haetae's dark powers.

00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:46.326
I still have one major obstacle.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:48.620
Taesan.

00:29:49.997 --> 00:29:52.874
The tiger's still prowling around Mirr.

00:29:54.584 --> 00:29:55.627
Don't worry.

00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:59.214
Taesan and the other angels' powers
were sealed beyond the Hellmouth.

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:01.258
Besides,

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:03.593
even Taesan has a weak spot.

00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:11.893
{\an8}ANGEL CAPITAL GROUP

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.479
Doni.

00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.983
Doni, get up already.

00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.573
What's going on?

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:26.366
Have you seen Chief?

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.701
Where, in my dream?

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:29.536
No, today, in the real world.

00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:31.997
I haven't. I was sleeping up until now.

00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:34.124
Where could he have gone?

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:57.355
Did you talk to Wonseung?

00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:59.608
Yes, I told him to keep it a secret.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:03.904
If it gets dangerous, just run.

00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:04.988
I'll handle them.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.365
Hey,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.119
are you belittling me
or looking out for me?

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:14.664
You know full well I'm the only one
whose powers aren't sealed.

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:21.588
I've got this.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:24.466
Stay right behind me.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.718
I can't have you die, old man.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.816
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.862
"GEUMSOON'S STREET FOOD"

00:31:49.658 --> 00:31:50.826
That's tasty.

00:31:58.542 --> 00:32:00.210
Business is unusually slow today.

00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:03.672
If it were any other day, I'd be swamped.

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:06.591
There's no harm in slowing down
every now and then.

00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:09.302
How about a drink?

00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.931
Cut back on that for your health.

00:32:13.515 --> 00:32:15.142
Even Mr. Taesan was worried.

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:17.727
I only drink a little,
so no need to worry.

00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:22.983
Welcome.

00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:33.410
I saw them enter the tunnel,

00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:36.538
but I couldn't see the entrance.

00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.543
There must be a dark magic barrier.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.069
Taesan.

00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.745
Chief, where are you?

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.413
Did you check your pendant? That's--

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.831
Give it here.

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:21.208
Chief, you must hurry.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.210
It's near Geumsoon's food cart.

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:45.023
As expected,
the angels walked right into the trap.

00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.192
Should I call for Ogwi?

00:34:02.666 --> 00:34:03.667
You must be

00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.294
the evil spirits
Mr. Taesan warned me about!

00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.675
No…

00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:14.719
Geumsoon, run!

00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:16.263
Go!

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:40.513
Should we report to the police?

00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.938
Manbok!

00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:51.399
Manbok, what happened? Where's Geumsoon?

00:35:51.483 --> 00:35:53.401
- Geumsoon…
- Where is she?

00:35:53.485 --> 00:35:55.612
- Over there.
- Where?

00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:57.238
Over there…

00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.199
Poor Geumsoon. Oh, no.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:59.259
{\an8}MR. TAESAN

00:37:21.656 --> 00:37:22.824
Mr. Taesan…

00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:26.995
Geumsoon, are you in there?

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.413
Geumsoon?

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:47.474
Geumsoon.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.353
Geumsoon, are you all right? Geumsoon?

00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:53.938
Marok!

00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:56.191
Old man, hurry in here.

00:37:57.942 --> 00:38:00.278
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Let's go.

00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:17.962
Let's go that way.

00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:23.343
Come on.

00:38:26.888 --> 00:38:27.931
Geez.

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.316
Geumsoon.

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.406
Get going with the others.

00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:48.409
- Doni and I have got this.
- What?

00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:49.702
You're here.

00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:50.787
Let's go.

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:52.872
- This way.
- Careful.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.672
The two of us aren't enough, Malsook.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:08.555
You're all dead meat.

00:39:40.753 --> 00:39:42.005
Malsook…

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.062
Malsook, are you okay?

00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:01.733
He's no joke.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.234
Obviously, Malsook.

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.581
- Wonseung, clear a path.
- Got it.

00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:22.879
That way.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.475
When will
our additional tteokbokki order be ready?

00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:02.979
It's almost ready,
but aren't you eating too much?

00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:05.398
Come on. Tteokbokki's only a snack.

00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:08.151
Since our job requires a lot of strength,
we can eat this much.

00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:09.944
Please give us more.

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.947
I'm grateful, but eating this much--

00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:14.407
More sundae and liver, please.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:15.491
What?

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.078
- Chief, isn't the sundae delicious?
- Sure thing.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.873
Doni and Jwidol
should be done collecting by now.

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:23.666
- Should I tell them to bring Bangwool?
- Sure.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.626
And the old man too. He might get upset.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.171
I've already called.
He's probably on his way.

00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:30.465
That reminds me. Chief, here.

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:34.844
"LEDGER"

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.389
Remember the goons who are
pulling scams with the land in Gangnam?

00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:41.017
- Right.
- When should we strike them?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.478
The sooner we act the better
because it's pretty big.

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:46.647
I'll have Jwidol open a bank account,
so proceed carefully.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.399
Don't worry about it

00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:50.151
- and watch us handle it.
- Sure.

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:52.528
What do you need me to do?

00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:54.989
Wait outside and pummel those leaving.

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:03.915
By the way,
have the thugs come back since?

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.583
Sorry?

00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:08.544
Gosh, no. Not even once.

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:11.839
And I owe it all to you
and your colleagues.

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:14.926
Thank you so much for helping us.

00:43:15.009 --> 00:43:18.262
You have it all wrong.
I wasn't trying to help you.

00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:20.807
I was only claiming my own land.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:25.186
Either way, let me know
if those thugs come back.

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:27.563
Got it. I won't forget
what you did for us.

00:43:28.147 --> 00:43:29.357
I said I wasn't trying to help.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.027
Mom, I'm back. I see a lot
of customers today. I'll wash the dishes.

00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:34.695
Forget it. Just go rest.

00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:37.073
Wait. That thug!

00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:40.535
- "That thug"?
- I mean, the man who took out the thugs.

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:45.123
You know,

00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:48.376
I drew that while thinking about
how you saved us that day.

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:51.671
{\an8}"STAR TTEOKBOKKI"

00:43:51.754 --> 00:43:55.258
You were like a star
shining brightly in the sky.

00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:56.968
Wait, a star?

00:43:58.386 --> 00:44:00.346
Maybe he's got a star face,
not star punches.

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.516
Thank you so much for saving us.

00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:07.186
What? I mean…

00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:10.064
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.859
Who knew Chief had this side to him?

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:15.945
Call me surprised.
She thinks he twinkles like a star.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.742
Here. This is for the food.

00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:24.537
Right.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.248
I'll head out first.

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:29.250
What? Chief, where are you going?

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.378
Thank you. Take care.

00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:34.255
Come again.

00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:44.891
Hold on. This is too much money.

00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:46.601
Geumsoon, stop him.

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.144
That's not necessary.

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:49.604
Keep whatever's in there.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.899
But it's too much.

00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:54.525
Just take it, ma'am.

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.986
Chief is shy like that.

00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:01.324
By the way,

00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:04.410
hasn't it been years
since Chief spoke to a human?

00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:05.494
"Years"?

00:45:05.578 --> 00:45:08.039
Hey, it's been over a century.

00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:09.457
Could he be sick or something?

00:45:10.458 --> 00:45:12.460
What's your chief's name?

00:45:13.169 --> 00:45:14.170
His name?

00:45:14.253 --> 00:45:15.379
Taesan.

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:53.889
