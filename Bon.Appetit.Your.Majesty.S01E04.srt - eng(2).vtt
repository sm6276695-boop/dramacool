00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.762
Being a tyrant's chef

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:56.681
means risking my life
on consecutive tests.

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:01.144
The situation calls for it
against my will.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.812
{\an8}YI HEON
KING OF JOSEON

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.783
Your Royal Highness,
please reveal the theme.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.035
GRAND ROYAL QUEEN DOWAGER INJU
YI HEON'S GRANDMOTHER

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.245
QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.042
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.346
MAENG MAN-SU
EIGHTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.931
EOM BONG-SIK
SEVENTH-RANK SENIOR COOK

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:14.259
What letter is that?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.012
That's cursive.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.139
What does that say?

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:20.807
Yi?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.891
Filial piety?

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:24.853
The theme of the competition is…

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:26.354
filial piety.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.150
Right. It can't be the family name, Yi.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.446
The food you will prepare
for this competition

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.074
should incorporate
the spirit of filial piety.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.326
The ingredients must include

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:44.330
tofu and doenjang, soybean paste.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.749
{\an8}You will have

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.335
{\an8}two hours.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.298
Now, you may begin.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.018
{\an8}THE COMPETITION BEGINS

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.730
{\an8}The current time is osibangak.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:09.856
{\an8}OSIBANGAK: AROUND NOON

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.071
FILIAL PIETY

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:22.869
I won't stand a chance
if I cook a traditional palace dish.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:24.704
Focus.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:29.417
Tofu and doenjang…

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.628
Daddy made something new for you.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:33.421
What's this?

00:03:33.504 --> 00:03:36.758
- Ever heard of doenjang pasta?
- Doenjang pasta?

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.217
It's so good, Dad.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:40.470
Is it? Eat up.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:42.847
That's it.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.935
Let's make doenjang pasta
that Dad often made for me.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:50.647
I'm sure the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
will like it.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:57.028
Gwinyeo. Do not make a mistake.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.197
There will be no mercy.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.158
What's with that smirk?

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.494
Unbelievable.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.758
The key to making good food
is using good ingredients.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.679
There's no way I'll lose.

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.723
My goodness.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.021
Your Majesty, you must be disappointed.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:36.109
You seem to have grown quite close
to the gwinyeo cook.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.570
Grandmother.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.698
They say you can only know
the depth of water by crossing it,

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.908
and that you can only know a person
by befriending them.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:48.746
It is too early to assume
who will become the winner.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.790
But you should know, Your Majesty,

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:54.752
I have been feeling rather tired lately

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.170
and have lost my appetite.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.506
You are known to be sensitive

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.009
and lack appetite,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.219
and yet you say you are tired
and have no appetite?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.764
That makes this competition
much more interesting.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:12.145
I look forward to seeing
if the new chief royal cook

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.024
can do well
and restore your lost appetite.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.863
She and her skills even dissuaded me

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.906
from taking her life.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:26.576
We will soon find out.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.204
We shall see

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.041
if things go your way.

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:36.461
Your Majesty, what I wish to cut today

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.463
is not the gwinyeo's arm.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.759
It is your heart that is drawn to her.

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:48.848
COURSE N° 4 **** AND SPINACH DOENJANG SOUP

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.456
{\an8}They took everything?

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.336
{\an8}No, give me that.

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.253
{\an8}Tofu.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.176
{\an8}Oh no. They're all smashed.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.763
Are you serious?

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:30.306
I can't believe those people.

00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:34.644
I have won.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.313
When it comes to gray mullet,

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.524
the ones with a white coat over their eyes
tend to be the tastiest.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.818
Come on, can you not even catch that?

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.487
Come here!

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.796
I don't mind that the tofu is crushed,

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.507
but I don't have enough doenjang
for anything.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.343
What do I do?

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:11.180
They're so nasty.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:13.391
What do I do?

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.979
This is spinach.

00:07:18.062 --> 00:07:19.188
It's really fresh.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:20.773
Then again,

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.734
spinach was introduced
in late-Goryeo and early-Joseon,

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:25.695
so it makes sense that they have some.

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:26.654
Right.

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:30.700
Spinach is good for bones and anemia,

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.702
so it's perfect for her,
considering her health condition.

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:34.245
Let's add spinach pesto.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.789
Okay, spinach.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.416
Why are you still here?

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:39.709
Mister Eunuch Yoon.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.961
{\an8}The other cooks already got
all the ingredients they needed

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.255
{\an8}and returned to the yard of the
Grand Royal Queen Dowager's quarters.

00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:47.383
- Could I get some doenjang?
- Doenjang?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.927
They must have some in the pot
in Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:53.431
The other cooks took everything,
so it's empty.

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.600
Oh dear. What to do about that?

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:58.311
{\an8}That is all the jeolmi doenjang
we have left.

00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.271
{\an8}So that was the doenjang
made with black soybeans.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:03.649
No wonder it was deep,
rich, and flavorful.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:05.151
What should I do now?

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:07.904
The quality of doenjang
decides the outcome of the dish.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.322
It is not jeolmi doenjang,

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:11.908
but we have some three-year-old doenjang
in the backyard.

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:13.284
Follow me.

00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.036
Do you really?

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.078
Thank you!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.622
Thank you, mister.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.166
A cooking competition?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.710
All sorts of petitions
and impertinent remarks

00:08:22.793 --> 00:08:26.214
have been going about the palace,
which in itself is a disgrace,

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:29.050
so it seems
Her Royal Highness decided to step in.

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.427
I understand her intentions,

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.056
but do we have the leisure
to wait for the result of a competition?

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:38.434
Even if the lowly wench were to win,

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.603
we must not accept the gwinyeo

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.563
becoming the chief royal cook.

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.774
You are frustratingly shortsighted.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:48.152
His Majesty will not step back.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.655
- How about we--
- Oh my goodness!

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:52.698
Oh dear.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.992
I apologize.

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.036
My hands are so weak.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:58.913
Do not worry about it.

00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:00.873
- It is fine, Your Highness.
- Goodness me.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.667
Your Highness.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.920
Please share your insight with us.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:10.841
Poop.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.469
I must go empty my bowels.

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.513
Where is the outhouse?

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:18.266
- Your Highness, are you all right?
- No.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:19.934
The outhouse. I cannot wait.

00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:21.310
- Where is it?
- Come with me.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.729
- Oh dear. Let us go.
- Be gentle.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.481
It has come out. Oh good lord.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.026
- Walk slowly.
- Do not touch me!

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.454
Cook Maeng.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.706
Is it eomandu you are making?

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.792
You may have learned
to cook in Waegwan, a Japanese village,

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.420
but you should know that
if the fish slices are not uniform,

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:32.298
the part that is wrapped
with the thinner slices will burst

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.175
when you steam them.

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:36.594
You are in no position to worry about me.

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.680
I see you are preparing yeonpotang.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.683
You should carefully watch
how long you cook the tofu.

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.145
I will take this opportunity to show you

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.647
what I learned in Sichuan.

00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:20.096
Relax, Yeon Ji-young. You can do this.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:13.524
It seems the gwinyeo cook made a dough.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:15.693
Could she be making noodles?

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:18.904
That is too simple a dish
for a competition.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:23.075
She is blanching a strange vegetable.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.369
I have never seen that in my life.

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.871
First Junior Consort Sung.

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:28.581
{\an8}Do you not even know spinage?

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.792
{\an8}It makes sense that you do not know
since you have never done any chores.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.711
Is that called spinage?

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:36.589
{\an8}But that is a muknamul
meant to be dried before eating.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.507
{\an8}MUKNAMUL: VEGETABLES MEANT TO BE DRIED
AND STORED FOR LATER CONSUMPTION

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.343
And now she is crushing it
with something else.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.096
Is she ignorant or just brave?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.266
It looks like the gwinyeo
will lose an arm today.

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.560
She will be crying out in pain soon.

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:51.103
Will you be quiet?

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.354
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.191
What could she be cooking?

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:59.069
The gwinyeo seems to lack in many ways
compared to the other cooks.

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:03.532
Cook Maeng seems to be making eomandu

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.451
Her Royal Highness praised
at the last banquet.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:10.080
It looks like Cook Eom is making
his famous yeonpotang.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:11.999
Just watching them
makes me feel hungry already.

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.711
Eomandu and yeonpotang.

00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:18.380
I look forward to tasting them.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:20.216
What about you, Your Majesty?

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.384
I am not so sure.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:23.886
No matter how good they are,

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.263
we already know what they taste like.

00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:30.184
You still seem to have great hope

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:33.437
about what the gwinyeo cook will make.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:34.355
Indeed.

00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:37.608
The chief royal cook's dishes
left me in awe every time.

00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.778
I cannot wait to find out

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.115
if I will also taste what you tasted

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.742
and be left in awe.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:49.370
You should feel it for yourself.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.081
Lips may tell lies,

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.543
but the tip of a tongue
only tells the truth.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.487
Doenjang soup carries a personal meaning
to Her Royal Highness,

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:24.822
so she often asks for it.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.533
A refreshing savory flavor?

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:30.411
She has always had a small appetite
since she was a child.

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:31.787
From what I heard,

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.622
she could not eat at all
on the day she entered the palace

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.000
because she cried so much
at the thought of leaving her parents.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.127
So she has a small appetite.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.546
I heard that the last food
her mother made for her

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.258
was soup made with doenjang
from the region near the Seomjin River.

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:46.635
Her mother mixed rice in the soup,

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.555
and she said the soup
she tasted then was excellent

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:52.016
and has been missing it ever since.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:56.270
I believe she said
it had a refreshing savory flavor.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:57.897
What then?

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.650
The cooks did their best
to replicate that flavor in their soups,

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.278
but she always said
it did not taste right.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.780
What do I do?

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:09.533
What gave the refreshing savory flavor

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.244
that the Grand Royal Queen Dowager misses?

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:16.540
Did she just feel that way because it was
the last meal her mother made for her?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.128
I don't think doenjang pasta
will be good enough.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:23.964
Miss.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.842
What are you doing
with your mind elsewhere?

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.761
You need to concentrate.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.310
The broth smells fantastic.

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.354
It is time to chop some green onions.

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:43.108
Oh dear. Did I use them up already?

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.404
Cook Maeng, lend me some green onions.

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:50.783
I put too much in my broth, you see.

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.953
Why are you not answering me?
Do you not hear me?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.038
Oh, come on.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.874
I asked you for some green onions.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.377
This is an official competition.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.922
Not preparing enough ingredients
is also a good reason for elimination.

00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:06.966
There can only be one chief royal cook.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.051
I did not take you
for that kind of person,

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.302
but you are so heartless.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.225
A refreshing savory flavor.

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.394
How did she make such a flavor?

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:19.895
What do I need to…

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.147
What are you doing?

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:23.482
Let go!

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.067
Why, you!

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.622
How could you?

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.335
Jeez, they're fighting
at a time like this?

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:04.940
A refreshing savory flavor.

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.192
That's it.

00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.655
I have enough to make the broth.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.414
- What are you doing?
- Just a moment.

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:22.249
Where are you running off to
during the competition?

00:17:22.332 --> 00:17:24.626
Just let me get something really quick!

00:17:27.337 --> 00:17:30.799
I need to get more ingredients.
It won't take long!

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:31.842
Bring her here.

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.635
But… Please.

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:35.846
Oh, come on.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:42.895
What is the matter?

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:47.733
I would like to get one more ingredient.
Could you please allow it?

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:49.693
What nonsense is this?

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:51.528
Return to your station this instant.

00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:53.489
I apologize.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.949
- But--
- What is the ingredient that you need?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.870
- It is--
- If I may interject,

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:02.206
this cannot be allowed, Your Majesty.

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:07.252
We do not yet know
what the other cooks will present.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.631
However, now that their dishes
are starting to take shape,

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.800
she wants to add an ingredient midway?

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.512
She must have realized
that she is no match for the other cooks

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.139
and is trying to change
what she is making.

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.850
The rule was to complete the dish
within the given time.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.019
No one said anything about
not being able to use more ingredients.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.438
Even if that were the case,

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.900
you have seen enough to know
what the other cooks are making.

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:33.987
It would not be fair to allow
the gwinyeo cook to add more ingredients.

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:41.537
It's true that I changed my mind
about my dish,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.414
but it's not for the reason you speak of.

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:49.002
Changing your dish midway
is not at all easy.

00:18:50.754 --> 00:18:52.131
There's no time!

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:55.050
That is your situation and your problem.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.051
Grandmother.

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.805
As Consort Kang said, it is unfair,

00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:01.056
but as the chief royal cook said,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.809
there were no rules against
using more ingredients either.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.063
So why not allow her
to use another ingredient,

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.399
and if she still loses,

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.778
we cut off both her arms?

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.158
You crazy bastard.

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.076
Keep your mouth shut.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.579
Man, he's really pissing me off.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.415
That is truly a great idea, Your Majesty.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.336
Very well then.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.589
However, as Consort Kang said,

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.550
if this turns out to be a trick
on His Majesty and me,

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.969
you must be prepared to give up your life.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:41.597
Okay.

00:19:42.389 --> 00:19:43.765
I understand.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.812
Ma'am, whether it's my arms or head,

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:51.273
it would be the end for me anyway.

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.410
I really don't have much time left.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.331
I can't finish in time if I leave now.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.002
Gil-geum.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.254
SEO GIL-GEUM
GIRL WITH HEIGHTENED SENSE OF SMELL

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:15.964
- Trust me.
- Thanks.

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:30.646
CHU-WOL
INSPECTOR COURT LADY

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:56.046
This is the only way to beat
their jeolmi doenjang.

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.006
I need to add a smoky flavor.

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.595
What is with that obnoxious antic?

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.681
What a crude act.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:41.717
What is she doing to the tofu?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.844
Did she just put it in oil?

00:21:46.013 --> 00:21:48.598
Just you wait, miss.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.489
Miss…

00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:18.170
What's taking Gil-geum so long?

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:30.432
- Cook Maeng does not disappoint.
- Great.

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.893
I cannot wait to taste his eomandu.

00:22:36.104 --> 00:22:39.191
Cook Eom's yeonpotang
looks marvelous as well.

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:43.528
It looks like a small banquet
is happening around the bowl.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:45.489
It certainly does.

00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:57.042
Did she just put fresh spinage
into the hot broth?

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.169
It is simply absurd
to put muknamul in soup.

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.420
What did you say?

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:03.381
She put spinage in the doenjang soup?

00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:09.346
Is this a new dish,
or have you lost your mind, Cook Yeon?

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.473
You must have my grandmother

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:14.184
taste the exquisite flavors
of your dishes.

00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:23.610
Please, Gil-geum.

00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:25.112
I need you here now.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.330
Miss.

00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:38.625
Gil-geum!

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:42.921
Gil-geum!

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.173
I know I am late.

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:47.217
- I am sorry.
- What happened?

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:48.844
Is that blood on your head?

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:51.054
I will explain later.

00:23:51.138 --> 00:23:52.597
Hurry up and take this.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:53.932
Thank you, Gil-geum.

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:55.725
Now go.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:23:58.687
Do not act recklessly, all right?

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:06.778
Perfect. I can use them right away.

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:17.330
What did the gwinyeo cook put in the pot?

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:19.833
That is…

00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:23.253
I am afraid I do not know what that is.

00:24:23.336 --> 00:24:24.713
You do not know?

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:28.592
Earlier on, she added spinage to the soup.

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:31.178
Did this kind of cooking method exist?

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:34.097
It is clearly doenjang soup,

00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:36.516
but she is making it
in a way I have never seen before.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.853
This is so very bizarre.

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:43.064
What if we all fall ill
after tasting that?

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:47.319
Can spinage cause an illness
when consumed improperly?

00:24:47.402 --> 00:24:48.486
Unfortunately,

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.573
I have never seen it
boiled or seasoned in such a manner

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.700
that I cannot say for certain.

00:24:53.783 --> 00:24:54.701
What?

00:24:54.784 --> 00:24:56.578
How are we to eat something like that?

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:59.497
Shall I tell her to stop cooking?

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.544
Are you insulting my authority?

00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.756
I ordered a competition
for the position of the chief royal cook.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.717
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
I implore you.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.637
- I have committed a grave sin.
- Your Majesty.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.765
Her words were merely based on the rules.

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.392
She would not dare to insult you.

00:25:19.476 --> 00:25:21.311
Do not be so angry.

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:22.354
The rules?

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:30.946
Did you just say "the rules"?

00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:34.157
This competition was held
because you doubted

00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:35.909
the chief royal cook's skills
in the first place.

00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:37.452
In other words,

00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:39.788
you doubted the sanity and authority

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:43.250
of the king who appointed her.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:45.085
- Your Majesty.
- However, I agreed to the competition

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:49.381
because I understood everyone's concern,
as this was unprecedented.

00:25:49.464 --> 00:25:50.632
If you were to stop the competition

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:53.677
even before trying the food,
using rules as an excuse,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.845
just because Cook Yeon
is making something you do not recognize,

00:25:55.929 --> 00:25:58.848
how would that make me look
when I issued a royal command

00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.226
for them to compete
for the position of the chief royal cook?

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:04.104
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:26:04.187 --> 00:26:05.397
You are right,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.942
and there is no law forbidding her
from becoming the chief royal cook.

00:26:09.025 --> 00:26:10.277
All I wish

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.905
is that this does not become
a disruptive precedent.

00:26:13.989 --> 00:26:16.866
I see very clearly how you feel,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.538
so all that is left is to taste the food
and then decide.

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:24.040
This competition

00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:27.794
was planned with the sole purpose
of getting rid of the chief royal cook.

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.379
Do not think that I am not aware of that.

00:26:32.507 --> 00:26:33.550
Do finish on time.

00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.218
Please.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.554
All hands off.

00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:28.980
Cook Yeon.

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.399
It is down to the taste now.

00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:34.069
Will you officially become my cook,

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:36.988
or will your life end now?

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:52.921
{\an8}EOMANDU: A JOSEON ROYAL COURT DISH
OF STEAMED DUMPLINGS

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.632
{\an8}WITH THIN SLICES OF FISH
USED AS THE DUMPLING SKIN

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:45.724
It is moist and tender.

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:50.228
How is it so moist,
unlike most other dumplings?

00:28:50.812 --> 00:28:52.647
Your Royal Highness, the secret to that

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.358
is the wrapping made with
gray mullet flesh sliced thinly enough

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:57.527
that you can see through it.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.904
This eomandu is incredibly tender.

00:29:02.449 --> 00:29:05.118
Wrapping made with gray mullet flesh
coated with starch flour.

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.620
The stuffing made with finely minced beef,

00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:09.789
stir-fried cucumber,
mung bean sprouts, and tofu

00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:12.333
comes together and bursts out at once,

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:14.002
flooding the mouth with flavor.

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:17.213
I am always in awe
of His Majesty's sense of taste.

00:29:17.797 --> 00:29:21.259
The eomandu was so delicious.
I am lost for words.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:22.510
It is delicious.

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:24.137
However…

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.975
I do not taste the doenjang.

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:34.147
I mixed some doenjang
with vinegar and honey

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.274
to make the dipping sauce.

00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:39.652
The dipping sauce.

00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:54.793
The doenjang does shine through.

00:29:56.211 --> 00:29:57.086
Still, it is a shame

00:29:58.213 --> 00:29:59.756
that you used it only for the sauce.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.468
I am enamored by the texture of the fish

00:30:03.551 --> 00:30:05.929
that melts away
the moment it touches my tongue.

00:30:06.012 --> 00:30:09.057
Every ingredient in the stuffing
retained its moisture

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.935
while it was cooked to perfection.

00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:13.853
That is very true.

00:30:13.937 --> 00:30:17.732
It is an ideal food
for someone my age to enjoy.

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.484
I thank you for your generous praise.

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:23.655
So, how would you say

00:30:23.738 --> 00:30:25.824
this dish speaks of filial piety?

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:29.327
His Majesty is the father figure
of all his subjects.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.997
His people sent ingredients from all over
as a child would to a parent,

00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:34.791
and with that,

00:30:34.874 --> 00:30:37.502
I have prepared a dish for you,
Your Royal Highness.

00:30:37.585 --> 00:30:39.838
If that were not
the pinnacle of filial piety,

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.881
I would not know what is.

00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:44.759
That is a sensible answer.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.636
It is a wise answer.

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.722
If it is as you say,

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:52.433
that would apply to all the dishes
in the palace since they are made

00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:54.602
with ingredients received as tribute.

00:31:06.656 --> 00:31:10.368
{\an8}YEONPOTANG: A JOSEON ROYAL COURT DISH

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:13.872
{\an8}OF CLEAR SOUP
WITH TOFU COOKED IN THE BROTH

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:16.457
Is this not tofu yeonpotang?

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:19.002
It is, Your Royal Highness.

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:22.338
I remembered how much you enjoyed it
at the last banquet,

00:31:22.422 --> 00:31:24.173
and I did my best today.

00:31:50.783 --> 00:31:52.619
It has a very clean taste.

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:56.539
Is there a particular reason
the pan-fried tofu has such a clean taste?

00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:59.417
Instead of using beef for the stuffing,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.711
I used minced chicken,
which makes it less greasy.

00:32:01.794 --> 00:32:04.130
That is why it is lighter and cleaner
to the taste.

00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:07.258
How did you cook the pan-fried tofu?

00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:09.385
I cooked the sliced tofu on a griddle,

00:32:09.469 --> 00:32:12.221
then tied them with water parsley
for the added fragrance.

00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:14.682
I then cooked it in chicken broth

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.185
mixed with jeolmi doenjang
to add depth to the flavor.

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:20.980
That is why the pan-fried tofu
and the soup paired well together.

00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:23.650
The aroma of the various rare mushrooms
was also delectable.

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:25.735
I am eternally honored, Your Majesty.

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:27.695
I enhanced the flavor

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.656
by using Pyogo mushrooms from Jinan
and caterpillar fungus,

00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.699
which is good for boosting one's energy.

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:37.538
What is the filial piety
that your yeonpotang represents?

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:39.415
According to the ancient Chinese book,
Myeongsim Bogam,

00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:42.085
everything is accomplished
when a household is harmonious,

00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:45.755
and the parents are filled with joy
when the children are filial.

00:32:45.838 --> 00:32:48.174
I prepared this dish

00:32:48.257 --> 00:32:50.969
hoping that all the descendants
of the royal family

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:52.971
could gather round
and eat this warm meal together.

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:55.974
This is a warm dish
that parents and children

00:32:56.057 --> 00:32:58.935
could sit around together and share.

00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:00.812
Yes, that is true.

00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:03.648
I am reminded of your banquet,
Your Royal Highness.

00:33:03.731 --> 00:33:07.110
This time,
the pan-fried tofu tasted better.

00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:09.112
It has an even richer flavor.

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.617
Are you saying

00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:18.788
that extravagant dish
represents a child's love for a parent?

00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:23.126
Yes. That is so, Your Majesty.

00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:45.898
Just soup?

00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:49.610
Is he an ally or an enemy?

00:33:50.236 --> 00:33:51.612
What were you thinking

00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:53.948
when you made this?

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:58.911
This is a special doenjang soup for you,
Your Royal Highness.

00:34:00.246 --> 00:34:01.414
Please taste it.

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:38.576
What's with those looks?

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.953
Does it taste good or bad?

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.791
It is a refreshing savory flavor.

00:34:44.874 --> 00:34:48.127
It is amazing
that she thought to add this.

00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:51.047
Wait, did he figure out what I used?

00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:54.509
He really does have
an absolute sense of taste.

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:16.114
So, what filial piety
does your food speak of?

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:20.243
This dish represents
filial piety in many ways.

00:35:20.326 --> 00:35:22.787
First, the doenjang soup,
made with stir-fried doenjang,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.665
that has a deep flavor
that calls to mind a mother's cooking.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.044
Second, the deep-fried tofu
that enhances the flavor of the tofu.

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:33.339
- Inside--
- Stop rambling and get to the point.

00:35:33.422 --> 00:35:35.383
Or I will have
your arm cut off this instant!

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.425
Enough.

00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:41.389
This food…

00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:47.854
represents filial piety.

00:36:11.919 --> 00:36:13.087
Thank goodness she's eating it.

00:36:14.088 --> 00:36:15.840
What a relief.

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.221
No, Mother.

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:25.266
I do not want to eat. I just want to go.

00:36:26.142 --> 00:36:27.852
If you do not eat anything,

00:36:28.394 --> 00:36:31.689
the journey to the palace
will exhaust you.

00:36:31.772 --> 00:36:34.108
I really do not want to eat.

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.987
I sent someone
all the way to the Seomjin River

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.780
to procure this doenjang.

00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:43.659
I will rarely get to see you
once you enter the palace.

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:46.913
Please, just have a bite.

00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:19.320
How mysterious.

00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:22.615
How was she able to create this taste?

00:37:24.492 --> 00:37:27.703
I hoped to scold her
with a lecture on filial piety.

00:37:28.329 --> 00:37:29.747
Instead, she has served me a dish

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.541
that questions the very meaning of it.

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.544
The ingredient…

00:37:37.088 --> 00:37:39.257
The last ingredient you added.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.218
What was it?

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:45.137
{\an8}They were clams.

00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:53.312
Nothing beats clams
when making a refreshing broth.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.273
In Joseon,

00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:58.276
only people living by the Seomjin
or Nakdong River could eat them.

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:00.611
The clean taste of the clams

00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:04.824
the chief royal cook added
by putting both of her arms on the line

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.702
has enhanced
the refreshing flavor of the soup.

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.499
Nicely said, my tyrant.

00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:17.295
That little wench.

00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:20.673
So that is how she has been
seducing His Majesty.

00:38:21.424 --> 00:38:22.925
By clams,

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:27.221
do you mean the small shellfish
that are used in regular shellfish soup?

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:29.181
Yes, that's right.

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:32.643
That's the secret
to the refreshing savory flavor

00:38:32.727 --> 00:38:34.729
that you've searched for your whole life.

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:39.692
The last bowl of doenjang soup
your mother made you

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:43.487
would've tasted of clams
from the Seomjin River.

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:48.242
I included that refreshing flavor
in my doenjang soup.

00:38:58.294 --> 00:38:59.211
However,

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:02.506
this is the first time
I am trying it like this.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:07.261
Where did you get the idea
to add spinage to doenjang soup?

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:10.598
It is very tender and sweet.

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:13.225
Wait. Why is she asking
something so obvious?

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:16.937
Did I just become the creator
of clam and spinach doenjang soup?

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.566
Spinage becomes sweeter and softer

00:39:20.649 --> 00:39:24.528
when cooked in soup,
and it goes well with doenjang.

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.655
It also tastes good,
blanched and seasoned,

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:27.907
so I served that as a side.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.992
- And also--
- Also what?

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.328
It weighed on my mind

00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:35.915
that you were having trouble keeping
your balance and shaking your hands.

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:39.835
Spinage is good
for bone health and anemia,

00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:42.755
so eating it often
will benefit your health.

00:39:46.092 --> 00:39:47.301
Your Royal Highness.

00:39:48.928 --> 00:39:51.347
{\an8}There's that saying we all know,
sikyakdongwon.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.682
{\an8}It means food and medicine
are of one origin.

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.811
Rather than with the help
of bitter medicine,

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:59.647
I hope you can maintain your health
with tasty food.

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:10.324
You are truly clever and thoughtful.

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:16.288
I will no longer

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.624
question who you are.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.543
However,

00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:24.505
will you make me
a dish like this again next time?

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:25.714
Pardon?

00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:31.429
Yes, I will.

00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:37.184
It looks like

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:40.312
we have a winner.

00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:51.657
The winner of today's competition is…

00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.292
Cook Yeon.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.885
I get to live.

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.970
Thank you so much!

00:41:13.053 --> 00:41:15.514
Dad, I made it!

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.310
The spinage doenjang soup Cook Yeon made

00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:22.354
truly captured the spirit of filial piety.

00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:24.315
With a method never seen before,

00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:26.567
she used clams and spinage

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.111
and created a refreshing savory flavor

00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.780
in a dish that also improves
one's health and energy.

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.576
She has truly moved me.

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:43.626
As of this moment,
the chief royal cook of the royal kitchen…

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:49.173
is Ji-young of the Yeon family.

00:41:54.887 --> 00:41:56.347
Very well then.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.683
- You all did very well today.
- Thank goodness.

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:05.689
Now…

00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:09.944
The time for punishment has come.

00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:19.912
Have the two cooks
who lost the competition

00:42:19.995 --> 00:42:21.372
kneel before the straw cutters!

00:42:21.455 --> 00:42:22.623
- What?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:23.666
Your Grace…

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.505
He's actually going to cut their arms?

00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:33.092
Put their arms under the blade.

00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:35.219
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

00:42:37.304 --> 00:42:38.347
No.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:39.473
No!

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.642
No!

00:42:43.185 --> 00:42:44.520
No.

00:42:57.575 --> 00:42:59.159
No! Wait, Your Majesty!

00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:07.167
How dare you interrupt?

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.338
I may be out of line to say this,

00:43:12.214 --> 00:43:14.633
but if you chop off their arms,

00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:16.343
you will ruin the competition.

00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:18.345
Is that what you want?

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.764
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:22.266
A deal is a deal.

00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:26.478
No!

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.147
Your Majesty!

00:43:30.482 --> 00:43:32.526
The theme of competition was filial piety.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.612
Step aside while I let you.

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:35.571
Your Majesty.

00:43:35.654 --> 00:43:39.867
Her Royal Highness maintained her health
thanks to the food

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.869
these two cooks have prepared
all this time.

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:43.954
Wouldn't it be unfilial

00:43:44.038 --> 00:43:46.081
to cut off the arms of such cooks?

00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:48.959
How brazen of you.

00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:51.337
I let you live because you can cook,

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.881
and you dare try to lecture me?

00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:56.133
Do you truly wish to die?

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.427
I wish to live.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.679
And so must they.

00:44:00.763 --> 00:44:03.974
Cutting the arm of a cook
is no different from killing them.

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:06.435
We only competed to create better dishes.

00:44:06.518 --> 00:44:09.063
I don't understand
why we should die for it!

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.814
Shut your mouth!

00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.203
Your Majesty.

00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:27.790
Cook Yeon is right.

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:31.460
Forgive the other two cooks.

00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:34.338
The fault is with me

00:44:34.421 --> 00:44:39.051
for failing to understand your will
and intention in the first place.

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:43.472
The truth is,

00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:48.060
it saddened me to see you despise deer

00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:50.396
and find enjoyment in hunting them

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:53.774
because of the late king's
fondness for them.

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.277
Then I heard that Cook Yeon

00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:00.864
had thoughtlessly served you deer meat,

00:45:00.948 --> 00:45:04.576
which is why I came up with the theme
of filial piety to scorn her.

00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:07.454
FILIAL PIETY

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:10.290
Oh, so that was the story behind this?

00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:13.961
He really is something else, isn't he?

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:16.547
How could he do that
even if he hated his father?

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.840
However,

00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:21.301
Cook Yeon,
who is now the chief royal cook,

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:23.554
has made me rethink the notion

00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:26.765
of filial piety with her food.

00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:31.979
I see why you value her so much.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:33.522
Your Majesty.

00:45:34.106 --> 00:45:35.482
How about

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.527
you leave it at this for today?

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:44.992
Still…

00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.704
a competition is a competition.

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.416
We must make a clear distinction
between reward and punishment.

00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:55.836
In that case,

00:45:55.919 --> 00:46:01.383
how about you have the two cooks
learn from Cook Yeon for a while,

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:06.513
as a means of teaching them to be filial
and loyal to the royal family?

00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:12.561
- Spare us, Your Majesty!
- Please spare us, Your Majesty!

00:46:12.644 --> 00:46:14.271
Your Majesty!

00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:17.441
Your Majesty. Please.

00:46:18.066 --> 00:46:21.570
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!
- Have mercy, Your Majesty!

00:46:24.323 --> 00:46:27.242
- Spare me, Your Majesty!
- Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.454
- Spare me, Your Majesty!
- Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:31.830
Please, Your Majesty.

00:46:31.914 --> 00:46:33.665
- Spare me, Your Majesty!
- Spare me, Your Majesty!

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:52.768
Listen carefully, you two cooks.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.897
The rules of the competition
should be honored.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.898
However,

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.401
since the new chief royal cook
and Her Royal Highness pleaded with me,

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.111
I will make a special exception this time

00:47:04.029 --> 00:47:05.697
and spare your lives.

00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:09.076
As Her Royal Highness has said,

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:11.745
the two cooks who lost

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:14.039
will learn how to cook from Cook Yeon
for the time being.

00:47:14.873 --> 00:47:18.210
With that,
we will conclude this competition.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.421
Take away the straw cutters.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.756
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.516
Your Majesty.

00:47:33.058 --> 00:47:35.936
Will you join me for some tea?

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.063
- I feel rather--
- Perhaps the doenjang soup

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:41.191
reminded you of someone you missed.

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:42.442
You seem to be

00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:45.404
unusually generous today.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.841
Let us go inside.

00:48:15.517 --> 00:48:18.145
Now, there should be no more complaints

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:20.105
about the gwinyeo cook.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:24.151
Did you see Consort Kang
walk off first in a huff?

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.695
She was angry
that she did not get her way.

00:48:27.279 --> 00:48:28.113
Leave her be.

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.490
I no longer

00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:34.328
have to hear her meaningless chatter
about visiting me more often.

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:37.205
I cannot help but mention that it seemed

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:41.585
His Majesty's temper suddenly flared
after the competition ended.

00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:42.878
You are right.

00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:47.299
It troubles my mind to think
he may know something about the incident.

00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:48.550
If that is not the case,

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:50.802
His Majesty would have no reason

00:48:50.886 --> 00:48:53.639
to be so cold toward Her Royal Highness.

00:48:53.722 --> 00:48:55.807
Do you hear yourselves right now?

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:58.602
Are you not aware that you are speaking
of things that should not be spoken aloud?

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.688
Perhaps the doenjang soup

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.899
reminded you of someone you missed.

00:49:03.982 --> 00:49:08.070
You seem to be unusually generous today.

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:11.823
Who is to say that is our fault?

00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:16.411
{\an8}The deposed Queen Yeon should not have
done something so disgraceful.

00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:18.330
Thinking that His Majesty might know

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.082
sends chills down my spine.

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.168
Should we not come up with a plan?

00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:24.336
That is enough.

00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:25.420
His Majesty believes

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:28.215
his mother passed away
due to an illness when he was young.

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:30.342
He does not know she was deposed
and poisoned to death.

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:31.843
Who knows?

00:49:32.427 --> 00:49:35.722
He could have someone
looking into the matter in secret.

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:38.141
That is enough.

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:42.813
Even if His Majesty finds out
what happened to his mother,

00:49:42.896 --> 00:49:44.523
what could he do?

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:48.485
Even if I were to go back in time,

00:49:50.278 --> 00:49:52.364
I would make the same decision.

00:49:57.119 --> 00:50:00.414
I believe Her Grace Consort Kang
was also present.

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:01.456
{\an8}It seems that

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.959
{\an8}the groundless rumor that you exiled
Governor Hong because of Cook Yeon

00:50:04.042 --> 00:50:06.002
started at Jahongwon.

00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:08.964
Consort Kang set this up.

00:50:09.965 --> 00:50:11.216
Halt.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.262
Chang-seon.

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.304
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:18.557
Where is Consort Kang?

00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:21.435
I heard she returned to Jahongwon.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.437
Let us head there.

00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:35.157
Oh gosh, my legs are aching.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:39.995
There's nothing easy in life.

00:50:40.078 --> 00:50:41.747
- Don't you agree, Gil-geum?
- Yes.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.751
I was so worried
they were going to lose an arm.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.885
What is this for?

00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:56.928
Well,

00:50:57.512 --> 00:50:59.639
thank you for what you did earlier.

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:02.184
I learned a thing or two
about cooking from you as well.

00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:04.853
No need to thank me.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.898
We all work hard for a living.

00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:10.275
I'm grateful that you appreciate it.

00:51:11.693 --> 00:51:13.779
Jeez, I'm so thirsty.

00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:16.990
I wish someone would get me some water.

00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:21.411
I wish

00:51:21.995 --> 00:51:24.623
someone would get me some water.

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:41.807
I acknowledge that you are
extremely lucky,

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:43.934
and that luck saved us all today.

00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:46.645
- Yes, your luck--
- My goodness.

00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:49.689
What a long-winded way
of saying thank you.

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:01.201
I'm a little hungry.

00:52:02.327 --> 00:52:04.162
Are there any leftover eomandu?

00:52:04.746 --> 00:52:06.248
Eomandu?

00:52:06.331 --> 00:52:07.499
Yeah.

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:13.713
Are there any leftovers?

00:52:16.424 --> 00:52:18.134
Darn it!

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.775
Goodness, Man-su.

00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:42.826
My gosh, miss.

00:52:42.909 --> 00:52:46.913
It really feels like you have become
the chief royal cook now. What a relief.

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:49.332
I think I've put the royal kitchen
in order now.

00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:53.545
By the way, Gil-geum,
is your head injury all right?

00:52:53.628 --> 00:52:54.504
What happened?

00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:57.257
Well, you see…

00:52:57.799 --> 00:53:01.011
I was returning from Saongwon
with the ingredient you asked for

00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:04.097
when someone suddenly hit me
and made me fall.

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.974
That's when I smacked my head
on the ground.

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:08.852
Is that true, Gil-geum?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:53:08.935 --> 00:53:09.895
Let me see.

00:53:11.646 --> 00:53:14.649
How could I tell you when you were
in the middle of a competition?

00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:16.985
I really am okay though.

00:53:17.068 --> 00:53:18.737
Who was it? Did you see their face?

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.114
No, I did not.

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:24.576
I held on to the clam basket
even as I fell down.

00:53:24.659 --> 00:53:26.745
- Who is that?
- Then a man suddenly appeared

00:53:26.828 --> 00:53:30.206
{\an8}and shouted at the culprit,
so they quickly ran away.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:34.544
It was the handsome jester, Gong-gil.

00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:36.463
Gong-gil?

00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:44.596
She is no ordinary woman for sure.

00:53:44.679 --> 00:53:47.724
She will cause trouble one day
if I let her be.

00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:49.768
That wench has an ulterior motive.

00:53:49.851 --> 00:53:52.187
She must be a spy planted by someone.

00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:55.315
However, it is a fact
that she is a skilled cook.

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.651
His Majesty is keeping her around
for a reason.

00:53:57.734 --> 00:54:00.028
Shall I have her kidnapped and sold?

00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:03.198
She has luck on her side,
so do not act rashly.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.535
I must set a trap.

00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:09.412
A trap?

00:54:10.121 --> 00:54:12.707
His Majesty the King has arrived.

00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.176
What happened?

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:25.762
Were you worried about me?

00:54:25.845 --> 00:54:28.139
The lengthy competition
gave me a headache,

00:54:28.223 --> 00:54:30.517
so I left early to rest.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.353
I heard you were the one
who organized the competition.

00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:35.897
Moreover, I heard that the false rumor

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:38.233
that I exiled Hong Gyeong-dal
because of Cook Yeon

00:54:38.733 --> 00:54:40.860
started right here at Jahongwon.

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.530
Your Majesty.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:53.873
Tell me.

00:54:57.919 --> 00:54:58.920
Why did you do it?

00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:02.674
Answer my question! Why did you do it?

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:06.761
Do you not know that questioning
the chief royal cook appointed by me

00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:10.432
is no different
from questioning my authority?

00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:11.558
This is…

00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:15.729
not the time
for you to coddle the gwinyeo.

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:16.855
What did you say?

00:55:16.938 --> 00:55:20.150
You used to spend sleepless nights
searching for the sworn enemy

00:55:20.233 --> 00:55:22.068
who drove your mother to her death.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:24.696
Have you already forgotten
what happened that day?

00:55:24.779 --> 00:55:27.991
You said you remember
the day your mother was deposed.

00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:30.493
You said you would avenge
her wrongful death!

00:55:30.577 --> 00:55:31.619
Did you not?

00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:33.496
Shut your mouth.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.751
Do not dare speak of
what happened to my mother.

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.461
Not only did you bring

00:55:39.544 --> 00:55:42.005
a woman of unknown birth
to the palace at this important time,

00:55:42.088 --> 00:55:44.924
but you also appointed her
as the chief royal cook.

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:47.510
So how do you expect me
to just sit back and watch?

00:55:47.594 --> 00:55:50.388
Is that why you acted
without coming to me first?

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.348
I am

00:55:53.058 --> 00:55:54.851
extremely disappointed in you.

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:56.519
Misunderstandings

00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:59.606
start with something trivial,

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:02.275
but once they take root,
there is no stopping them.

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.360
Just like how the late king

00:56:04.444 --> 00:56:06.988
came to misunderstand your mother.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.406
Shut your mouth!

00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:10.366
Shut…

00:56:11.117 --> 00:56:12.118
that mouth.

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:17.040
The sworn enemy
who drove your mother to her death.

00:56:17.123 --> 00:56:19.375
You said you remember
the day your mother was deposed.

00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:21.711
Just like how the late king
came to misunderstand your mother.

00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:24.130
You said you would avenge
her wrongful death!

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.090
Did you not?

00:56:25.173 --> 00:56:26.299
Your Majesty.

00:56:28.093 --> 00:56:29.177
Are you all right?

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.179
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:34.891
I will help you relax.

00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:38.353
Calm down, Your Majesty.

00:56:38.436 --> 00:56:39.604
Leave it!

00:56:39.687 --> 00:56:40.897
Leave me alone.

00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:49.405
Your Majesty.

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:52.617
Your Majesty!

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:10.802
{\an8}The gwinyeo cook
must be something amazing indeed.

00:57:10.885 --> 00:57:13.721
To think she was recognized

00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:16.141
{\an8}by the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
in the competition.

00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.851
{\an8}Now I am curious

00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:20.311
about the food that cook makes.

00:57:20.395 --> 00:57:23.565
You should, of course,
taste the food one day.

00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:25.942
{\an8}His Majesty's physical examination
is next month.

00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:30.280
{\an8}How about tasting the gwinyeo's food
when you dine with him then?

00:57:30.363 --> 00:57:33.158
Yes, that is a good idea.

00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:36.494
So, what have you found out
about the Salgoji Forest assassin?

00:57:36.578 --> 00:57:38.997
You were right, Your Highness.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.790
Director Kim Yang-son,
the older brother of Kim I-son,

00:57:40.874 --> 00:57:43.293
whose corpse was desecrated
during the Muin Literati Purge,

00:57:44.252 --> 00:57:46.546
had acted on his own.

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:51.885
I told them over and over that no one
was to act out until the right time.

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:54.679
Did you find the assassin?

00:57:54.762 --> 00:57:56.806
We did, however--

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:57.974
Did you lose him?

00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:02.103
His face was covered with a mask,

00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:05.148
but his movements
were as agile and swift as the wind.

00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:07.567
He must be quite the master of his trade.

00:58:12.655 --> 00:58:15.158
Your Highness, please give me three days.

00:58:15.241 --> 00:58:18.328
I will find him myself and end his life.

00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:23.082
Forget it.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:26.085
There is something more urgent
you must do tonight.

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:28.588
They are an important figure,

00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:31.424
so be well-prepared.

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:37.722
I heard you proved your skills
in the competition yet again.

00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:48.066
I will find your handybag or bundle
or whatever it is one day.

00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:51.236
This is a great opportunity
to win over His Majesty.

00:58:51.319 --> 00:58:56.157
His Majesty likes well-adorned women,
so embellish yourself with the jewelry.

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.619
No, wait.

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.871
What are you talking about?

00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:04.415
- You must be mistaken.
- What do you mean?

00:59:04.499 --> 00:59:07.210
There's no flirting or anything going on
between His Majesty and me.

00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:09.045
- Right, Gil-geum?
- What?

00:59:09.128 --> 00:59:10.588
Yes, that is right.

00:59:10.672 --> 00:59:13.967
- They are not blurting or anything.
- "Blurt"?

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.176
"Flirt," not "blurt."

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.302
- Flirt?
- Flirt.

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:18.096
- Yes, flirt.
- "Flirt."

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:19.973
What in the world are you saying?

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.140
What I mean is,

00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:26.854
His Majesty doesn't fancy me
or favor me that much.

00:59:26.938 --> 00:59:28.231
That's my point.

00:59:28.314 --> 00:59:30.358
- Yes, that is the truth.
- You fools!

00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:32.694
You are truly ungrateful.

00:59:32.777 --> 00:59:37.365
Do you truly not know what His Majesty
is putting up with to protect you?

00:59:37.448 --> 00:59:39.909
Are you talking about the competition?

00:59:40.952 --> 00:59:45.790
It may look like he protected me,
but that wasn't all there was to it.

00:59:45.873 --> 00:59:49.586
My cooking skills
are what convinced everyone that--

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:54.674
Do you honestly think you survived
with your skills alone?

00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:56.551
What?

00:59:57.218 --> 00:59:59.971
Are you there, Cook Yeon?
It is time to prepare His Majesty's meal.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.974
Understood. Please give us a moment.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.643
- I shall visit another time.
- Wait.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.353
You need to finish what you were saying.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.563
What about His Majesty?

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:14.360
I hope that His Majesty enjoys

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:15.945
your blurting.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:20.992
Is he kidding me right now?

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:22.994
Look at him blurting out nonsense.

01:00:24.245 --> 01:00:25.413
Sorry, we're late.

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:27.081
We apologize for that.

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.629
This is going to be the first royal meal
that I prepare as the chief royal cook.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.547
Please follow my instructions.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.591
First, Cook Eom--

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:37.800
Everyone.

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:40.219
Eunuch Yoon.

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:43.556
I have bad news.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.809
His Majesty had a fit at Jahongwon,

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.604
and he just retired to his chambers.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:51.689
- Pardon?
- He still has fits?

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.192
He seems to have calmed down for now,

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:56.903
but he returned to his chambers
in an extremely sensitive state.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.158
It is possible that someone could die
serving tonight's meal.

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:07.246
Be sure to double
and triple-check everything

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.248
until the very end.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.167
- Yes, Eunuch Yoon.
- Yes, Eunuch Yoon.

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:15.755
His Majesty has fits?

01:01:16.547 --> 01:01:18.257
When things get bad…

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:21.386
Who poisoned my food?

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.554
Throwing tables and bowls

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:25.682
and making a mess is the least of it.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.977
Sometimes, he trembles all over
and says he hears things.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:31.104
Once a fit takes hold,

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.564
everyone in the palace freezes in fear.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:36.025
Your Majesty, are you all right?

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.736
Only Consort Kang can console him.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.740
He's a famous tyrant,

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.534
but this is news to me.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.245
What will you do?

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.087
He's usually so normal.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:57.672
Right.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:02:00.925
The traits of a tyrant
and the strange behavior

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:03.052
could be symptoms of a wounded heart.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.012
That and the whole deal
with his mother being deposed.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:15.106
For dinner today, we will serve something
to console His Majesty.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.568
Are you sure about this?

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.779
I'm not,

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:26.117
but I'll do my best
to survive this day as well.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:37.003
I see them, miss. They are coming out.

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.380
Okay. Is it working fine?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.335
My gosh.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:21.589
Do you all wish to die?

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.175
I will not let you be!

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:31.516
Your Majesty.

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.643
{\an8}Your seoksura, evening meal, is ready.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.493
Leave, all of you!

01:03:50.576 --> 01:03:53.830
What shall we do with your meal?

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.166
Do you wish to be killed?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.753
- Do not make me repeat myself!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.635
Wait!

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:14.600
The blue ribbon in your hair
tells me you are the chief royal cook.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.772
I'm screwed.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.072
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:30.074
You shall stay.

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:56.601
So,

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.061
what did you prepare this time?

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:04.984
Noodles?

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.488
Today's special dinner menu

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:11.365
is doenjang pasta.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.826
The noodles are made with buckwheat flour,

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:18.706
and the sauce is made with salty
stir-fried doenjang and savory clams.

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:21.459
How dare you insult me?

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.669
I had doenjang earlier in the day!

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.672
He's definitely
extremely on edge right now.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.425
He was fine during the competition.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.385
Your Majesty.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.639
This is called "pasta,"

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:38.267
and it's Italian for "dough."

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:41.395
The base of the sauce
may be the same doenjang,

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.064
but it's a completely different dish.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.484
It means "buster" in "stallion"?

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:47.985
"Stallion"?

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:50.863
Pasta.

01:05:51.572 --> 01:05:52.865
"Bastra"?

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.117
Pasta.

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:56.869
- Pas…
- Pas…

01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:02.124
Taste the food.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.069
Please try it.

01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:58.389
I'll show you.

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:01.684
You hold it like this and…

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.484
Open your mouth.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:30.713
"Busta."

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:06.832
I had doenjang earlier as well,
but it tastes so different now.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:10.628
Together with the spinage,
it is smooth and sweet.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:13.798
On top of that, the earthy buckwheat
and the savoriness of the clams

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.050
linger in my mouth until the end.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:17.093
That's right.

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:19.720
Very accurate.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.681
This doenjang pasta

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:27.019
is what my dad made me
whenever I was upset.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.857
I'm sure you had
a lot to think about today.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:35.820
I also had a terribly long day,

01:08:36.570 --> 01:08:39.198
so I made it with memories of my dad.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:41.617
I see.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.329
What about your mother?

01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:49.667
She passed away when I was young.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.507
You must have felt lonely.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.804
You must have been in a lot of pain.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.640
Is he consoling me?

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:07.560
He's just as lonely
with no one to turn to.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.105
You must have felt alone, just like me.

01:09:13.607 --> 01:09:16.902
Where is your father right now?

01:09:18.445 --> 01:09:22.783
He's probably desperately looking for me.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.162
He must not know
you are here in the palace.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:28.497
Shall I send him a message?

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.624
No, Your Majesty.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.712
It seems you still don't believe me,
even though I've told you many times,

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.381
but I really am from the future.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:44.013
I'd be able to prove it
if only I had my handbag.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:47.349
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it!

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.559
Thank you!

01:09:50.811 --> 01:09:53.564
Do you mean the bundle

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.983
- I threw over the cliff?
- Yes.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.277
There's a book

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.696
called Mangunrok in that handbag.

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:04.408
You'd be able to believe me
if only I had it.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.619
"Mangunrok"?

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:11.207
What kind of book is Mangunrok?

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.210
If I'm right,

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:18.839
I believe it's the book
that brought me here.

01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:20.883
It brought you here?

01:10:22.843 --> 01:10:23.844
How so?

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:28.599
By time-slipping.

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:36.065
A magic book that sent me here

01:10:36.982 --> 01:10:38.025
from the future.

01:10:39.026 --> 01:10:41.862
I do not understand a word you are saying.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.280
Very well.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.493
Tell me about my future.

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:50.162
If you get it right, I will believe you.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.916
And I will send my troops if needed
to recover your bundle.

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:55.334
What do you say?

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.419
Listen, Yeonhuigun.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.464
{\an8}The Gapshin Literati Purge
happens in the near future.

01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:02.925
{\an8}RETALIATION WHERE YEONHUIGUN EXECUTED
OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN HIS MOTHER'S DEATH

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:06.387
{\an8}Go on. Tell me what you know.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.307
It happens in the Year of Gapshin,
Year of the Blue Monkey,

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:14.687
{\an8}a revolt ensues,
and you get dethroned and deposed.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.148
{\an8}How am I supposed to tell you that
when history can't be changed?

01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:22.611
So you want to know
about the future, right?

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.450
Then let me see…

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:30.703
First,

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.872
you must get through this year well.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:36.458
Hold back, even if you get angry,

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.460
and beware of those close to you.

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:09.908
Will the Gapshin Literati Purge
actually happen?

01:12:12.536 --> 01:12:14.621
I'm not in the position
to worry about someone else.

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.042
What should I do?

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.555
CLAM DOENJANG PAASTA

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.642
On the 20th day of the Month of Gyeongjin,
which fell on the Gihae day,

01:12:35.726 --> 01:12:37.311
the chief royal cook placed first

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:39.813
in the competition hosted
by the Grand Royal Queen Dowager.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.233
{\an8}It has been many years since I ordered
Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:44.651
{\an8}to find the draft
of the historical record.

01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:46.779
He will return today

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.824
with the secret of what happened
to my mother 20 years ago.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.999
There's a book called Mangunrok
in that handbag.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:00.667
A book called Mangunrok.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.419
There's a book called Mangunrok.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.129
"Mangunrok."

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.132
Mangunrok…

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:15.140
Does it mean "to yearn for the clouds"?

01:13:21.021 --> 01:13:22.898
MANGUNROK

01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:26.568
MANGUNROK

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.138
Your Majesty, it is I,
the commander of Urimwi.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:55.722
You may enter.

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.645
What is it?

01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:04.148
Your Majesty, I have bad news.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.732
Principal Drafter Yi Jang-gyun

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:06.942
has vanished.

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:09.319
What? Yi Jang-gyun has vanished?

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:10.237
Yes.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.613
I was to meet him tonight

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.574
at the twenty-second hour
at the North Gate,

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:16.160
but he did not appear,
so I searched the area

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:20.080
and found this in a spot
stained with a lot of blood.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:27.629
- Was he attacked by an assassin?
- Yes.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:28.672
Kill him!

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.010
Let us go.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.471
Judging from the blood
and fallen identification plaque,

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.639
it seems certain
he was attacked by an assassin.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:40.976
This is outrageous.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:48.150
No one else knew
about the order I gave him.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.570
Who could have done this?

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:55.657
What crime could my mother have committed

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.868
that they are trying so hard to hide it?

01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:00.204
It is possible

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:04.249
that every one of them
was involved in her death.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.128
All of those who wish to retain
their position and power.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.594
I cannot trust anyone.

01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:19.014
Then again…

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:22.684
I was always alone anyway.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:26.730
Your Majesty.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:29.149
The wind is cold.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.319
Please return to your chambers.

01:15:32.986 --> 01:15:34.446
Bring me a drink.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.324
A drink, Your Majesty?

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:40.661
I need to get drunk tonight.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:15:58.887
Your Majesty.

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:00.389
Drinking on an empty stomach

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:03.559
will harm your health.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.519
I shall request a juansang,
so you can have some food.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.663
Cook Yeon, are you in there?

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.249
Cook Yeon.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:30.586
Yes. I'm coming.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.755
This is just crazy.

01:16:34.464 --> 01:16:37.509
Why does he not sleep?

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:47.436
Your Majesty, your juansang is ready.

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:01.533
Your Majesty.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.747
Your Majesty, are you all right?

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:11.668
You are here.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.296
Is he drunk?

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.381
He reeks of alcohol.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.635
It's one thing after another with him.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.806
Yes. I brought your juansang--

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.733
Well, Your Majesty…

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:40.947
Stay still.

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.368
But I…

01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:46.536
Stay as you are.

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:49.873
Just for a while.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:38.690
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.403
{\an8}Do you not remember
what happened last night?

01:19:47.657 --> 01:19:48.950
{\an8}I'm going to destroy you!

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.579
{\an8}What is it? What about the draft?

01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:56.458
{\an8}I will prepare the natgeotsang
after the physical examination today.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:00.712
{\an8}I'll prepare my natgeotsang as planned.

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.800
{\an8}Who is the chief envoy this time?

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:08.428
{\an8}I was told he brought
as many as three cooks.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:10.263
{\an8}We're expecting a special guest today.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.098
{\an8}Brace yourselves, envoys.

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:20.148
